## About Me
<p align="justify"> As a Data Scientist I completed projects that are close to real-life company problems. Currently I study Data Science on a daily basis, and I have a career objective of getting a job as a Data Scientist and therefore help in finding solutions for business issues through data. </p>

<p align="justify"> I graduated in Economic Sciences at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) in July 2022. Professionally, I worked as an intern in Banrisul, from May 2019 to May 2021. </p>

<p align="justify"> At this point in my career, I feel confident to work as a Data Scientist, so that I can create value by using my knowledge in Python, Statistics, Machine Learning, Storytelling as well as other tools, in order to build data solutions that can solve companies' problems. </p>

## Data Science Projects
### [**Creating a customer ranking system for an insurance company**](https://github.com/brunodifranco/project-insuricare-ranking)
<p align="justify"> In this Learning to Rank project I used Python, Flask and Classification Algorithms to create a client ranking system for Insuricare, a fictitious insurance company that is willing to sell a new vehicle insurance to new clients. The reason for ranking is to determine which customers to prioritize, given a limit call restriction. Insuricare already had a model that randomly selected customers to call, however, by using Data Science a full list of customers sorted by propensity score was provided, and for future clients a spreadsheet is available, returning the sorted propensity score for each requested client. Financially, with a very reasonable annual premium this solution could bring Insuricare up to US$ 25 million annually, which is around 89% better than Insuricare's original model. </p>

### [**Creating a bot that predicts Rossmann future sales**](https://github.com/brunodifranco/project-rossmann-sales)
<p align="justify"> In this project I used Python, Flask and Regression Algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost and Light GBM Regressors) to predict Rossmann sales, a drug store chain, six weeks in advance. Reason being Rossmann CEO needs to determine the best resource allocation for each store renovation. The final solution is a Telegram Bot that returns a sales prediction of any given available store number, with the possibility of being accessed from anywhere. </p>

### [**Business solution for a real estate company**](https://github.com/brunodifranco/project-house-rocket-insights)
<p align="justify"> In this insights project I used Python and Streamlit to solve a profit maximization problem for House Rocket, a fictitious real estate company, by suggesting whether a property should or shouldn't be bought and resold. If this feasible solution strategy were applied the total obtained profit would be around US$ 473 million, with an average profit of 45 thousand dollars per property. </p>

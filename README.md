## About Me
I'm 22, born and currently living in Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. I graduated in Economic Sciences at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) in July, 2022. Professionaly, I worked as an intern in Banrisul, from May 2019 to May 2021. 

I had my first contact with Data Science during my sophomore year in college, when I took the Econometrics course by August, 2019. Around the middle part of 2020, I learned Python on my own, latter on taking the ‚ÄúIBM Data Science‚Äù course by Coursera. More recently, from January to May 2022, I was again using Data Science tools and knowledge in my Undergraduate Final Paper: <a href="https://lume.ufrgs.br/handle/10183/238972">‚ÄúPolitical News and Future Markets Returns‚Äù</a>.

Currenly, I study Data Science on a daily basis, having the professional goal to get job as a Data Scientist, and therefore help in finding solutions for business issues.

## About Me
<p align="justify"> I'm 22, born and currently living in Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. I'm a Data Scientist, with complete projects that are close to real life company problems. Currently I study Data Science on a daily basis. I've the professional goal to get job as a Data Scientist, and therefore help in finding solutions for business issues. </p>

<p align="justify"> I graduated in Economic Sciences at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) in July, 2022. Professionally, I worked as an intern in Banrisul, from May 2019 to May 2021. </p>

<p align="justify"> I had my first contact with Data Science during my second year in college, when I took the Econometrics course in August 2019. In mid-2020, I learned Python by myself and then I took the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/ZWQ3NK8U7LY5?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=sharing_cta&utm_product=prof"> “IBM Data Science” </a> course in Coursera. Most recently, from January to May 2022, I once again used Data Science tools and knowledge in my final undergraduate paper, <a href="https://lume.ufrgs.br/handle/10183/238972">“Political News and Future Markets Returns”</a>. </p>

## Data Science Projects

### [**Business solution for real estate company**](https://github.com/brunodifranco/project-house-rocket-insights)

<p align="justify"> In this insights project I used Python and Streamlit to solve a profit maximization problem for House Rocket, a fictitious real estate company, by suggesting whether a property should or should't be bought and resold. If this feasible solution strategy were applied the total obtained profit would be around US$ 473 million, with an average profit of 45 thousand dollars per property. </p>
